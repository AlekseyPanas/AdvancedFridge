# AdvancedFridge

### About
This project was done for Stuyhacks, a high school hackathon. 

The premise of the project is to create software for a theoretical smart fridge invention which
manages all your fridge contents for you through a dashboard. 

This project does not go with any actual hardware prototypes and is completely theoretical. However,
even in its "software only" state, it can be used to help keep track of products in your fridge!

### Features
- Dashboard showing all products with their time left until expired, and a separate list highlighting already expired products
- Add products to the fridge list via manual entry (custom product names allowed)
- Scan barcodes using webcam to detect products more quickly
- A currently very tiny food database with minimal products for testing (plans to connect to a larger database)
- Remove products from fridge via "take" button

### Planned Features
Additional features in mind:
- Connect the app to a larger food database (such as myfitnesspal) to give access to thousands of foods and information about them
- Add Nutrition and calorie information/features into the dashboard (search by calories, search by carbs, etc)
