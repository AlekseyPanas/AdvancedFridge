# AdvancedFridge

### About
This project was done for Stuyhacks, a high school hackathon. 

The premise of the project is to create software for a theoretical smart fridge invention which
manages all your fridge contents for you through a dashboard. 

This project does not go
with any actual hardware prototypes and is completely theoretical. It includes
use of the camera sensor, and simulates a weight scale class, among other things, but
the primary aspect is the management of the main dashboard through which this fridge
would be controller
